# CodeKnight 1.0## Contest Details* **Duration**: 2 hours* **Start date**: Aug 14 2018, 11:30 pm CST* **End date**: Aug 15 2018, 01:30 am CST## Problems### Magical Cards#### Problem Description:Alice found a magical deck of cards numbered from **2** to **1,00,000**. Alice will pick up a card and she has to tell the **number of ways** she can make that number printed on card by using their prime factors else she will die. She doesnâ€™t know how to find this. Being Alice's friend you have to help her in finding out number of permutations.#### Input Format:First line of the input consists of an integer **T** (no. of testcases).Each testcase contains a single integer **N**.#### Output Format:Print a single integer (number of ways she can make a number by their prime factors) for each testcase.#### Constraints:1 <= **T** <= 100000<br>1 < **N** <= 100000---### Chef and Cakes#### Problem Description:Chef Ashu has **N** bases for cakes. Bases with the same area can be placed over one another. Since Ashu is a lazy chef he wants to make **minimum number of cakes**. You need to tell him the minimum number of cakes that he can make by using all the **N** bases and also the **height** of the tallest cake that he can make.#### Input Format:First line contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases.First line of each test case contains an integer **N** denoting the number of bases.Second line consists of **N** space separated integers **A[i]** denoting the areas of the bases.#### Output Format:Output consists of two space separated integers **M** and **H** denoting the minimum number of cakes that can be made by using all the bases and the height of the tallest cake respectively.#### Constraints:1 <= **t** <= 100<br>1 <= **N** <= 10^5<br>1 <= **A[i]** <= 10^9
